> are you proactive or reactive in your social life?

i am definitely proactive, although i wasn't always that way. ian really showed me how to be that person.

> do you have an *anam cara*?

probably ren. i tend to go to them for really difficult life advice, and i never feel weird about being completely honest with them.

> are you an *anam cara*?

less sure about this one. maybe to julia? lauren comes to mind, too.
