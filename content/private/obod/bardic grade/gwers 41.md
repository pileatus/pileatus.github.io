> what do i need to do, to feel more at home in the world?

i already feel pretty homey as-is. i feel like i’ve gotten more involved in the stuff i always *thought* i should be doing, which is really nice. this year especially with the meetup, the community garden, and the mastodon instance i’m running.

> what do i need to do, to feel more at home in my body?

i could definitely stand to do more yoga. i signed up for classes that’ll start next week, so that should help. yoga always makes me feel better about and more thankful for about my body.

> what do i need to do, to feel more at peace in my life?

i think i’m already doing a lot! i would like to come up with some kind of routine for my spiritual stuff. maybe always setting time aside once a week (or every other week) to work on my obod studies. i think having my own room will help with that.

> what do i need to do, to feel more passionate about life?

more cycling. spending more time in nature.

> what do i need to do, to feel more depth in my life?

gosh, this is quite the question. i don’t feel like my life is particularly shallow. i do miss having really close friendships with people geographically near me. courtney is probably the closest to that. maybe kelly, too.

> what do i need to do, to feel more freedom in my life?

having my own room is very freeing. it feels like my own space to do with as i please, and i don’t feel that anywhere else in the house. i do sometimes over schedule myself, which i know makes me irritable at times. saying no to any social thing feels like a missed opportunity, especially after the lockdowns.
