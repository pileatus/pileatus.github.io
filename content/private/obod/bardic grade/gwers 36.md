> what were the best moments in my life?

the best moments are all the moments with the dogs and my friends. biking, hiking, and camping bring me the most joy.

> what have i given to life, to the world?

i've given three dogs and two guinea pigs a great home and life. i regularly donate to causes to better the lives of others. i chose a career that also brings good into the world. i volunteer my time to good causes as well.

> what mistakes did i make, how much time did i waste, when did i go off-track?

like most people, i screwed up a lot in my early and mid-twenties. before then, too. i adopted a dog i shouldn't have, i didn't always treat people nicely, and i had some very selfish moments.

i'd like to think i've learned from those mistakes and have become a better, more kind, more caring person.
