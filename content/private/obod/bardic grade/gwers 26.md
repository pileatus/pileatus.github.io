> what do i yearn for?

happiness and health for myself, my chosen family, my friends, my dogs, my home, and nature.

> how would i describe my relationships, my social life?

most of my relationships are chosen. i tend to remove myself from people who do more harm to me than good. i am a social person, so i have a hard time saying no to events or hanging out.

> what do i need to do to improve my emotional and social life?

i think things are fairly good as-is! i would like to diversify my friends once the pandemic is under control. emotionally, i feel stable most of the time.

> to what extent have i developed my water qualities?

real bodies of water are a little bit scary to me because i can't swim. emotions do not scare me as much as they used to. if anything, i've become more stable over the years.

> to what extent am i in touch with the yin side of my nature?

i am very nurturing toward the dogs and plants. not so much toward humans or even myself sometimes.

> do i love the water in my being, or am i in conflict with it?

i am at peace with it.

> can i express my feelings easily, or do i hold them in until it's uncomfortable?

i feel i do a pretty good job of expressing my feelings when i have them.
