> what am i chasing in life?

i don't think i chase material things in life too much now that i'm financially stable. i do occasionally chase experiences like camping and traveling.

> what did i chase when i was younger?

i was much more into chasing money when i was younger and not totally stable. i also chased stable relationships since i felt like i lost that growing up.

> do i enjoy chasing?

i am decidedly *not* a fan of chasing. it's exhausting on so many levels, and i'd much rather be content with my life.

> do i enjoy being chased?

i don't mind a bit of being chased, though that can definitely get out of control. i tend to feel suffocated if somebody is chasing me too closely.

> what do i see others chasing?

i see other epople chasing money, family, and relationships. work and professional recognition, too. i don't think any of those are wrong to chase, they're just not for me.
