my older half is wearing a simple red dress. she has unkempt long, wavy grey hair. she speaks slowly and intentionally. i'm not sure of her age exactly, but maybe in her seventies or early eighties.

my younger self is eight or ten years old with long, unkempt straight brown hair. definitely a pattern there. she's wearing a t-shirt that's too big for her and jean shorts. obviously ready for adventuring in the woods!

the older woman reminds me that work isn't as important as enjoying the time outside of work, especially when it comes to nature. this is definitely the part of me that speaks to julia and corey with then work too much. i need to remember to listen to my own advice.

the younger version of me is the one that tends to take over when i'm in nature or working out. their advice to me is to stay true to who i've always wanted to be: a strong, independent person.
