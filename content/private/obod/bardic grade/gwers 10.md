> if my life was a story, what part of the story would i change?

overall, i'm pretty happy with my life and where it has led me. even considering the fairly messed up stuff my mother did, i feel like i've managed to overcome the worst of it in my own way.

> what do i yearn for? what is it that i most desire?

i am fairly content in my life. i don't want marriage or kids, which certainly simplifies things. i'm happy with my career and social life (or was before covid hit). i am already working on the smaller things i want to change: getting back into dog training and doing some volunteer work.
