**circle blessing with fire.** may this circle be blessed by fire.

**when laying the fire.** i lay this wood in the name of the sacred three: life, peace, and grace.

**when extinguishing the fire.** as the fire dies down, let it be relit in my heart. may my memory hold what the eye and ear have gained.
