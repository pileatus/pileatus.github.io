> what is the story of my life?

i'm not sure what this question is asking.

> how is my health, my physical body?

for the most part, good! currently healing from a bike crash into some gravel, which has been a bit rough mentally, but i know i'll be able to bounce back soon.

> do i enjoy having a body?

99.99% of the time, yes! i enjoy improving it and using it to get me from point a to point b, too.

> what do i need to do, if anything, to feel better, to be more healthy?

restrict my drinking and keep exercising.

> am i a practical, down to earth person?

terribly so! ren was just mentioning this as a quality of mine over the weekend.

> if not, is there anything i can do to develop the practical side of my nature?

i'm already a fairly practical person, so i don't think there's much to be done here. :)

> is there a project i could take on that could help me develop my practical self?

i tend to learn things as i need them. lately haven't needed to learn anything.

> to what extent have i developed earth qualities?

the earth has always been the element i've felt closest to.

> do i love my earthiness, or am i in conflict with it?

definitely enjoy being the rational, practical realist. it does sometimes make me feel like i come across too strong on occasion, though.

> does my birth sign give a clue as to my relationship with the earth?

aren't scropios supposed to be fire and water signs? if so, that doesn't explain anything!

> are there ways i can develop earth qualities in my life?

this is a place i already feel pretty comfortable, so i will likely choose not to focus on it for now.
