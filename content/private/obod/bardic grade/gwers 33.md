most of my everyday job is very airy/intellectional. computers feel really closely related to air to me. they are intangible in ways, but always around us.

i'm happy with my intellectual self for sure. i'm always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges.

i am an overthinker at times, and i love researching things before committing to them.

i'm fairly good at setting goals, but i get discouraged if things don't go according to plan.

i'd say i'm decent at expressing my thoughts clearly, but i do ramble on a bit at times.

i'm full up on projects!
