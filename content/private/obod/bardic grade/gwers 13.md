> what does afagddu represent to me?

lack of motivation and follow through. i've never been great at finishing things that i start. when i hit a hard part, i tend to give up or put it off for much longer than i should. i avoid the problem rather than facing it head on. this is most noticeable in my professional life, but it happens in my personal and social life, too.

> what does creirwy represent to me?

my patience and understanding. i tend to see the best in people (and other living things). i'm always very forgiving when somebody has something come up, and i don't take it personally. julia and i were talking about this today. i also like to think i'm not a reactionary person.
