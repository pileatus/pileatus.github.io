**psychic digestion.** events of the previous day. used to file things away. probably not worth analyzing.

**physiological.** a need or feeling translated into a dream, like food dreams when hungry or water dreams when thirsty.

**psychological.** a mental or emtional dream. used to solve things our conscious mind cannot. may offer a new prespective on a situation. try thinking of how the story might end or what it might be saying if it were somebody else's story.

**soul.** vivid or lucid dreams that take on other-worldly feeling.
