> where is the fire in my heart, soul, and belly?

i feel like i was a lot more fiery in my younger days. as i've grown, i've been able to taper that with more earth charactaristics.

> what is my burning desire, my passion?

cycling and dogs. oh, and camping. i'm straight-obsessed with these things!

> am i burnt out or dried up?

maybe a little? i do think i've been over-scheduling myself lately, but there's so many things i want to do!

> do i love or fight the fire?

pretty ok with it i suppose.

> am i tempermental?

only when i'm hungry!

> am i a victim to the fire of anger?

definitely not. i'm chill when it comes to almost everything.

i do feel like i could use more passion in my relationship with corey. i love him dearly, and i hope we can one day get that fiery feeling back. i know it's unlikely to be exactly the same, but i miss that intimacy we had.

as a kid, i was a victim of abuse, but i feel like i've worked through a lot of that in the past decade or so.

i'm an energentic person for sure, but even i overestimate my abilitites and get burnt out sometimes.
