the autumn equinox occurs in september. it's typically starting to get chilly at this point, and there's #pumpkin flavored everything (one of my favorites). i like to celebrate by having a day of food centered around pumpkin everything. pumpkin bread, pumpkin coffee, pumpkin pie, pumpkin beer! i also like to cozy up with a good book during this time.
