my first #introduction into #witchcraft. picked it up as a teenager and carried it around my rural indiana school. i was very edgy. ðŸ˜‰

reread it during the 2020 #pandemic, which reinvigorated my [studies](study.md), which had long been neglected.

while i don't subscribe to many of the beliefs in this book, i am glad it was accessible enough for me, a teenager who wanted to look into alternate religions.
