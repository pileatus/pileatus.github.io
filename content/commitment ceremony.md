## invocation

dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate autumn and corey as they make a promise of love and commitment to one another.

commiting to share their brightest days and weather out their darkest nights with someone is no small thing and cannot be done lightly.

commitment is about trust. it's about patience, forgiveness, and hope. it's what happens with a relationship becomes a home â€” a place of safety and love â€” to which each partner can return, again and again.

## readings, music, blessings

as we reflect on the profound power of trust and commitment to create strong and lasting families, we look to those who have been most touched by the love between autumn and corey.
