# april 11: new moon
intention: get loki ready for competition!

# april 16: waxing crescent
had a great lesson with alison; can't wait to go back next week! next step: pick a trial date.

# april 20: first quarter
another lesson tomorrow, so i'm going to ask alison when she thinks we should go compete. she probably already has some trials she's planning on attending.

# april 26: full moon
loki is registered with akc now! there's a trial in june that i think will be a good fit. going to double-check with alison that it's a good fit for us and see which games we should sign up for.

# april 30: waning gibbous
loki is officially signed up for a trial in june! we're doing two events saturday and two on sunday.

# may 3: last quarter
not sure that i'm doing a lot of giving back, but oh well! i think next moon is going to be focused on mentally preparing myself and loki for the trial. :)

# may 7: waning crescent
now that we're signed up for the trial, it's just a matter of waiting until the day is here. looking forward to it!
