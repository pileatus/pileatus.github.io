# may 11: new moon
this month is going to be all about preparing for our trial in mid-june! i'd like to spend some time in crowded, unfamiliar places to get loki used to that kind of thing. maybe practice near some of the local dog parks.

# may 15: waxing crescent
we did some fun practice in the yard this weekend. loki's weaves are really coming along! i want to work on his crating skills, too. he definitely needs that practice, if not for the trial, then for everyday life.
