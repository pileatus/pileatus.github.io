i leared about druidry, and specifically [obod](https://druidry.org/), when a friend spoke about it. (thanks, [betwixtcraft](https://betwixtcraft.com)!) it wasn't until at least a year or two later that i finally took the plunge and paid for the bardic grade [course material](https://druidry.org/our-courses/train-in-druidry).

i'm most of the way through the course now, on lesson (or gwers) 37/48. i've taken a break from it for awhile due to other things taking priority, but i hope to complete it sometime in mid-late 2022 and work on getting into the ovate grade after that.

there's a strong focus on [listening to nature](listen%20to%20nature.md) that obviously ties in well to my practice.
