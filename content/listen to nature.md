be mindful of your impact on #nature. not just in the ways that you change it, but in the people, organizations, and ideas you support. make the time to spend in nature, be it #walking, #cycling, #hiking, #camping, #gardening, or any other outdoor activity. #mindfulness

this can closely align with one of the other [pillars](pillars%20of%20practice.md): [respect the body](respect%20the%20body.md). it also aligns well with observing the [lunar](lunar.md) and [solar](solar.md) cycles, as those are part of the natural world. #observation

grow your own food when you can. [your garden](garden.md) is a practice in patience and dedication. it's also supremely rewarding!
