i'm not entirely done with this book, but since i've linked it on the index, i figured it was worth creating a page about it!

this might be, so far, my favorite book on spiritual practice. the author has a great way of putting things, owns up to his past mistakes, and hopes to help readers [learn](study.md) from his (and their) mistakes in the process.
