a tidy #hearth makes for a more relaxed mind. this goes for both the physical and #social hearth in your life.

in the physical realm, maintain some semblance of #organization. this can be difficult, especially when your mental health is suffering. which is why it's imortant to [be kind to yourself](be%20kind%20to%20yourself.md). however, remember that keeping that tidy hearth can improve your mental health.

disconnect from those people who don't serve you (or others) well. not to be confused with having a homogenous social circle (see also: [uplift the marginalized](uplift%20the%20marginalized.md), [study](study.md), and [listen before speaking](listen%20before%20speaking.md)).
