remember to be kind to yourself, especially if you're having a difficult day. take lots of #vacation, and use it primarily to [listen to nature](protect%20nature.md). #therapy, #medication, and other tools are there for you to use, and you should not feel ashamed to do so. [meditation](meditation.md) often helps you see things more clearly _before_ they overwhelm you.
