title: "pileatus"
---

this digital garden was largely inspired by [dabbler's guide to witchcraft](dabbler's%20guide%20to%20witchcraft.md), which drove me to write out and document my nature-based spirituality, starting with my [pillars of practice](pillars%20of%20practice.md).

the name `pileatus` comes from `dryocopus pileatus`, which is the scientific name for [pileated woodpeckers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pileated_woodpecker), a favorite animal of mine. this, of course, is another nod to one of the pillars: [listen to nature](listen%20to%20nature.md). it's rather difficult to ignore such a noisy bird!

i also write a [journal](/journal) when the mood strikes.

pileatus is written in [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and published using [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz). i use [github pages](https://github.com) to host the site.
