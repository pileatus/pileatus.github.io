title: "pileatus"
---

pileatus, a [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/digital-gardening/), was largely inspired by [the dabbler's guide to witchcraft](the%20dabbler's%20guide%20to%20witchcraft.md), which drove me to write out and document my nature-based spirituality, starting with my [pillars of practice](pillars%20of%20practice.md).

the name `pileatus` comes from `dryocopus pileatus`, which is the scientific name for [pileated woodpeckers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pileated_woodpecker), a favorite animal of mine. this, of course, is another nod to one of the pillars: [protect nature](protect%20nature.md). it's rather difficult to ignore such a noisy bird!

pileatus is written in [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and published using [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz). i use [github pages](https://github.com) to host the site.
