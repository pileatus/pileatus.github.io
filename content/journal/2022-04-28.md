soooo, i found a cute mastodon/hometown instance that's all about pagans/witches. i'm waiting on my account to be approved, but i'll be [@autumn@pagan.plus](https://pagan.plus/@autumn) on there if they approve me! that'll give me a slightly-more-private place to chat about things, since i can fine-tune the publicity of my posts there. i don't plan to abandon this journal, though!

i ordered some marigold pods/seeds for the indoor garden, and i'm really stoked to start growing them. i don't think i've ever grown flowers before, and i think these would look really nice somewhere outside. maybe by the mailbox? or near the steps? they look like soft, cushy pillows.
