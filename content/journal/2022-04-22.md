happy [earth day](earth%20day.md)! i won't get to do a lot of celebrating today, because i'm busy with work and then going out to dinner and a movie (_the northman_). i do plan to spend a little bit of [time in nature](listen%20to%20nature.md) today, even if it's just a few moments while i go outside and walk barefoot to the mailbox.

i was able to do today's [meditation](meditation.md) before work.

i got some [gardening](garden.md) in as well! i didnâ€™t think either of my broccoli plants were going to make it, but one of them is doing really well and it looks like the second one might make a comeback after all. i took the sticks out that were helping to hold up the tomatoes, too. they seemed sturdy enough without them.

i really need to work on the [commitment ceremony](commitment%20ceremony.md) celebrant stuff! maybe i'll try and do that this weekend. i need to do some [research](study.md) on druid celebrations, maybe some pagan stuff, or just make up my own from scratch.
