oh my, it has been awhile! between camping, volunteering at the garden, taking lots of bike rides through the woods, and spending time at the beach, i have not dedicated a whole lot of time to writing. i am still steadily working my way through the [obod](obod.md) gwersi, celebrating the passing of the seasons, and doing my best to observe the world around me.

i did want to mention that i recently finished reading *[braiding sweetgrass](braiding%20sweetgrass.md)* which i really enjoyed. it gave me a lot to think about when it comes to gratitude and my perceptions of what good things human people can do for the earth.

the fig tree is producing a *ton* of fruit this year, which means most of them are going to the bugs, squirrels, and my newest dog really seems to enjoy them, too. i'm hoping to oven-dry some of them for later, since i'm not a huge fan of fresh figs. i may even try my hand at some very simple fig jam! although most of the bugs the rotting fruit attracts are stinging insects, we did get a lovely visitor yesterday!
