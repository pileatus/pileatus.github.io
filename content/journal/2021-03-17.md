i wanted to write up a little overview of what i'm doing this weekend to celebrate the [spring equinox](spring%20equinox.md) here in the northern hemisphere.

## saturday

* volunteering with a [local community garden](http://wellfedgarden.org/).
* making egg-based dishes for every meal.

## sunday

* trash cleanup around the neighborhood (especially near the grocery store where we walk frequently).
* alban eilir / ostara ritual with the local grove.
* [obod](obod.md) chat with my friend who's also in the bardic grade.
