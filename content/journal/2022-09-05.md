oh, hello again. i'm still around! i had a very busy summer, and now with fall quickly approaching—and a free night to myself—it seemed like a good time to pull in my information from its various scattered homes both digital and physical.

i spent today consolidating all the things into this one place, and it feels so nice for everything to have a permanent ~home~.
