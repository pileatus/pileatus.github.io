no meditation this morning. i did manage to hop on my bike and ride to the coworking office. it's nice outside! riding my bike is one way i try to mitigate my impact on [climate change](protect%20nature.md). it's also a nice way to [take care of my body](respect%20the%20body.md).

somebody mentioned that this weekend is one of the [cross quarters](cross%20quarters.md)â€”[may 1](may%201)â€”which i had all but forgotten about. we'll be camping, but maybe i can do something small while we're out there.

listened to some more [dabbler's guide to witchcraft](the%20dabbler's%20guide%20to%20witchcraft.md) on the way to and from my after-work thing today. this book just keeps getting better, and i'm so excited to discuss it with the [sass witches](sass%20witches.md) discord server. ðŸ¤©
