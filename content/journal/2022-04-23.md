i didn't do a very good job of [respecting my body](respect%20the%20body.md) yesterday. woke up hungover. 😵‍💫

but hey, today is a new day, and i can take it easy and make sure i do a better job this time. i slept in much later than usual, and i plan to be [be kind to myself](be%20kind%20to%20yourself.md) today.
