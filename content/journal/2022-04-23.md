i didn't do a very good job of [respecting my body](respect%20the%20body.md) yesterday. woke up hungover. 😵‍💫

but hey, today is a new day, and i can take it easy and make sure i do a better job this time. i slept in much later than usual, and i plan to be [be kind to myself](be%20kind%20to%20yourself.md) today.

a button popped off my shorts last night, and instead of tossing them, i'm going to send them in for repairs. i'm really happy that [swrve](https://swrve.us) offers that service as an option. i think this is an awesome way to [respect nature](listen%20to%20nature.md). it tends to be cheaper, too!

managed to be kind to myself and respect my body better today. got to hang out with lots of friends, drank a few beers, but a lot more water. going to bed early because i need it.
