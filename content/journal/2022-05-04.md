i was re-reading my last post where i said, "i don't plan to abandon this journal." i wasn't kidding! it's been a busy past few days, but i have the night mostly to myself. camping went well, and i never _love_ coming back to the city, even though i know i would dislike living that far away from civilization.

our first night of camping, i actually sat down and started answering [the book club questions for the dabbler's guide to witchcraft](book%20club/the%20dabbler's%20guide%20to%20witchcraft.md). i'll continue to add to that as the questions are asked and i have a chance to answer them.

tomorrow is my half birthday, and i'd like to do a small observance of it tonight and renew my [studying](study.md) of [obod](obod.md).

in other news, the garden is absolutely thriving!
