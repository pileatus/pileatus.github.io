i have a few bushes i planted last year, and they are looking *rough*. in an effort to save them, i put some mulch around them to hopefully keep the weed population down. i think i may get rid of the tall grass around this bed and replace it with some flowers that would do well in this region, but i need to do some research on that first. maybe daffodils!

[gardening](garden.md) is not something i did before last year, but it's been a good way to get outside. my little garden sage plants survived the winter outside, my aloe survived inside, and my golden pothos is still kicking (although all her children died over the winter). i'm hoping i can propagate some more pothos plants and sprinkle them around the house.

much of being a [druid](obod.md) is connecting with nature, and gardening is such an obvious way to do so. tending to plants is relaxing and meditative.
