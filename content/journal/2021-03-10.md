one of the projects i've been working on over the past year has been renaming the [full moons](lunar.md), as the [traditional names](https://www.almanac.com/full-moon-names) aren't terribly relevant to the climate and wildlife where i live in the southeastern us.

i've been trying to pay close attention to nature during each month, and so this month is the daffodil moon. while on my walk last night, i noticed several neighbors' yards had bunches of daffodils, and they were all in full bloom.

i don't know any of the traditional meanings of daffodils, but yellow is my favorite color (so bright and cheery!), and seeing so many of them around makes it feel like spring.
