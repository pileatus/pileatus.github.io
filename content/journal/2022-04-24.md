got _plenty_ of sleep last night. even managed to squeeze in some [meditation](meditation.md) before drifting off. feeling a lot better today.

this afternoon, i'm heading to [a fairy festival](https://festivaloflegends.com), which should be lots of fun! i had hoped to meet up with a friend from [episitimi](episitimi.md), but their whole family is down with a stomach bug and won't be able to make it. ‚ù§‚Äçü©π

made some good progress on the [commitment ceremony](commitment%20ceremony.md) script! i think it's basically there, but we need to figure out the sand pouring stuff.

the fairy festival was great! saw some amusing acts, i got to wear the outfit that i plan to wear for the [commitment ceremony](commitment%20ceremony.md), ate some ravioli and baked potato, drank some mead and ale, and bought a super cute fox necklace from [trinket costumes](https://www.instagram.com/trinketscostumes/).
