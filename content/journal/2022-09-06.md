did some [cleaning](maintain%20the%20hearth.md) last night before bed and this morning before work. felt good to have the bedroom all cleaned up. i also opened the blinds in there, which i don't always do (but probably should be doing every day). i would still like to clean up the dresser—which is _very_ cluttered with nonsense—and vacuum the closet—which is full of dog hair—but other than that, i'm happy with the progress i've made so far.
