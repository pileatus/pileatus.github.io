back in january, before i even started my [obod](obod.md) journey, i got a letter from the arbor day foundation. thinking back on it, i think that letter may have spurred my interest in druidry again. i ended up making a donation, and i had mostly forgotten about it.

then, last week, my complimentary trees arrived (all twelve of them!), and i was talking to my partner about planting them, since he does most of the yard work. he asked if i wanted to plant them in a circle "for witchy shit," which was already my plan, but i was really happy he asked so i didn't have to be awkward about bringing it up!

i planted eight in a circle in the back yard, aligned with the cardinal and semi-cardinal directions. i'm _hoping_ i planted them far enough apart, but if we gotta move them a couple years down the road, i'm cool with that, too. the additional four trees got planted in the front yard for a little more privacy there, since it only has one tree.

## small plants update

* acquired a snake plant for the office, which was dreadfully void of green.
* added creeping rosemary to my herb planter where my garden sage (grown from seeds last year) has been thriving.
* planted four tomato seedlings for tasty summer snacking.
* might have shocked my poor pothos with too much sunlight, but i'm hoping it'll pull through.
* moved the aloe outside to a shady spot (has been living indoors for the winter).
