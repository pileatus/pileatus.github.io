yesterday was a busy day of biking! i didn't end up getting back until very late, so i ended up doing something tonight to celebrate my half birthday and recommitting to [obod](obod.md). just a small cleaning of my altar and some burning experiments. i composted all the bits i could, which was nice to be able to do.

turns out, buring dried [[basil]] leaves is not good! the smell was pretty bad, haha. but i guess experimenting with things is half the fun. also, [[cinnamon]] crackles (which startled me), but smells quite nice. maybe i should just stick to the incense i was gifted. ðŸ˜…

after work, i got to go on a walk with a friend, and we visited a nearby public garden. there were _so many_ birds out and about. including one that looked very ill and near the end of its life, unfortunately. felt like a good time of really getting into and enjoying [nature](protect%20nature.md).
