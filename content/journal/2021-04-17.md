this was my second month volunteering at the garden, and i enjoyed it just as much as [the first](journal/2021-03-20.md) (if not more, because it was warmer this go-around). the work was pretty straightforward, but i took lots of photos, so i'll share those here!

we planted onions; lots of them!

there was a *lot* of yarrow growing where it shouldn't be (the asparagus garden), so we weeded that out.

did you know passion fruit sells for $8/quart? they grow best on a trellis, so that'll go overtop the asparagus garden later this year.

there were lots of these neat-looking centipedes while i was weeding the asparagus garden.

i took a bunch of the yarrow home with me, so it's now part of my little herb garden. i also planted some basil seeds in the same container, so hopefully they'll take off like they did last year.
