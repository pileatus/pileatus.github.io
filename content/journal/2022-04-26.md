woke up early enough for [[meditation]], but not early enough for any exercise before work.

we had a big rain today! it was neat to see the (brief) storm blow through. always love some good rainy vibes. it's been warm enough lately to sit outside for lunch which has been nice, too.

after work, i did some indoor #cycling in an effort to [respect my body](respect%20the%20body.md). i haven't been doing a great job of that lately, so it was nice to be able to get some exercise in.
