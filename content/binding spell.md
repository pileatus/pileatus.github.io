1. light a candle.
2. as the candle is burning, write a letter to the subject of your spell, explaining why you would like them to stay away. (i use blue ink to signify freezing.)
3. fold the paper several times into a small square.
4. extinquish the candle, and use the wax to seal the paper.
5. put the paper in a bag, and wrap string/twine around it several times.
