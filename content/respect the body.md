keep your body in tune. eat using #mindfulness practices. think about where your food originates from. if you can't stomach the way the food is made, don't eat it.

#exercise regularly to keep your body in good, working condition. this can be #cycling, #walking, #hiking, #running, #playing, or any other activity that gets your heart beating a little bit faster. if possible, do these activities outside in conjunction with [listening to nature](listen%20to%20nature.md).

#recovery is an important part of your physical #health, so don't forget to go easy on yourself after an especially difficult workout, after injury, or during an illness. [gentler streak](https://gentler.app/) is a good reminder of this.
