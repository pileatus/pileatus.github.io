the spring [equinox](equinoxes.md) occurs in march. it's a time for renewal, regrowth, and warmth. it's also when my [gardening](garden.md) really kicks into gear, #camping season starts, and i can finally go #cycling more comfortably. i typically celebrate this by camping or doing some other outdoor activity.

in [obod](obod.md), this day is called alban eilir.
