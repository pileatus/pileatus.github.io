before inserting your own opinion into a conversation, think about whether or not you are centering yourself. i'm a habitual "problem solver," and i am constantly reminding myself that no, not everybody wants advice on how to solve their problems. sometimes they only want to vent, complain, or just commiserate with other folks. they also _usually_ don't want to hear about the time you also went through something similar.

there's an excellent chapter in [dabbler's guide to witchcraft](dabbler's%20guide%20to%20witchcraft.md) about this very topic, and i could definitely see my past (and sometimes present!) self in what he talks about.
