How did you come to know the lie was incorrect?\n\nprobably, but i don't remember a specific instance.\n\n\u003e How can we find better answers when researching magic, religion, and culture?\n\ni feel like this is getting easier every day! i remember trying to [research](study.md) things as a teenager, and it was _so hard_ to do so.\n\n## chapter 1\n\n\u003e Who was your \"first witch?\" Were there other witches in media that influenced your desire to be a witch?\n\ndefinitely willow of _buffy the vampire slayer_! i had a huge crush on her as a kid (still do). i went as her for halloween one year, even dying my hair red to match. ‚ú®\n\nsince then, sookie (of _true blood_) who is technically a fairy, but what's the difference really? also _the witch_ is my favorite move. üòç\n\ni have a hot take about that movie, which is basically: she escaped her shitty family, and the ending is actually a great one for her.\n\n\u003e How have the media's depictions of witches negatively shaped the perception of witchcraft?\n\ni think this was mentioned in the book, but they're often very evil and ugly! which, okay, sometimes we are, but not as much as media depicts, haha.\n\n\u003e The author refers to the movie The Craft and says \"Magic can look like having a picnic in the woods with your friends.\" What feels magic to you?\n\nanything in [nature](protect%20nature.md). camping with friends. riding my bike. howling at the [moon](lunar.md).\n\n\u003e What was your first witchcraft book?\n\n_the idiot's guide to wicca and witchcraft._ i read it when i was maybe fifteen? i don't feel like i've kept a lot of that around, but it definitely felt magical at that age.\n\n## chapter 2\n\n\u003e How does magic work? What can it be used for? What can it not be used for?\n\nit's powerfully psychological. it works better on the witch than anyone else.\n\n\u003e The author says when you use a spell, you still have to put in work. He gives the example that if you do a spell to get hired, you still have to go out and look for jobs. Do you think SASS magic and non-SASS magic have this in common? What other things do they have in common?\n\neven the more magically inclined folks i've seen still tell you to do the work! it's a boost to what's already there.\n\n\u003e The author also quotes Terry Pratchett‚Äî\"It doesn't stop being magic, just because you know how it works.\" What is something you understand but is still magical to you?\n\nso. many. things. i've seen various magic tricks (like, magicians), and even when i see them explained in great detail, it's still magical. same goes for knowing what the [moon](lunar.md) is. it's still this giant thing we can see in the sky, and that's neat!\n\n## chapter 3\n\n\u003e If you've had a spell fail, what did you do?\n\nhonestly? not much of anything. i don't consider a spell a failure, because getting myself in the right mindset to do a spell is a success in and of itself. magic is mundane in my personal view.\n\n\u003e The author says that magic is a tool and failure is a part of growth and magic. As a SASS witch, are there skills you need to learn to practice more effective magic?\n\n[studying](study.md), [listening to nature](protect%20nature.md), and thinking more deeply are big parts of my [practice](pillars%20of%20practice.md). so yeah, i had to [learn](study.md) those skills better in order to be more effective.\n\n\u003e The author says Circumstances are the big C of magic. He defines circumstances that are important as emotional state, focus, and intent. How do these affect your ability to practice magic?\n\nwithout those, there is no magic! haha. at least not for me. those _are_ the pieces of magic‚Äînot the physical tools (as much as i love them).\n\n\u003e He says ‚Äúnot having a clear understanding of what you need often leads to an undesirable result,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMagic is most effective when it‚Äôs reasonable, clearly defined, and possible.‚Äù Do you agree with this? And if so, what can you do to make your magic more effective?\n\nabsolutely. this is classic goal setting, and in some ways, i think magic is a way to frame our goals, ambitions, hopes, and dreams.\n\n\u003e Why do people lie about their magical successes? How does this impact how other‚Äôs see magic?\n\nhearing a spell didn't work is _boring._ it's the same reason we don't share that we lost a competition. it feels like there's no reason to tell anyone about our failures. i think this makes it out to be like magic can solve any problem, which isn't the reality of things.\n\n## chapter 4\n\n\u003e Aside from the examples discussed by the author, can you think of any other witches in history?\n\nbeen a minute since i've read this chapter. i do often do a \"hmmm\" when people label popular figures as witches, especially when that person is no longer alive and can't accept or reject the term.\n\n\u003e What historical witches have most impacted society‚Äôs perception of witches?\n\ni'm not super well versed in the various historical witches. maybe i need to do some more [studying](study.md) on this. üòÖ\n\n\u003e What falsities remain popular about the Salem Witch trials? What other theories have you heard about what happened? Do you think any of the witches were really practicing witchcraft?\n\nthe whole \"burned at the stake\" thing was something i didn't know was false, so definitely that one! i know it's a common meme to say, \"we're the children of the witches you didn't burn,\" or something along those lines. i'm sure some folks were practicing folk magic of some kind. just about _everybody_ was. it's sorta ingrained into all cultures to a degree.\n\n\u003e The author offers several examples of witchcraft as ‚Äúpeople finding power when they thought they had none,‚Äù and as a form of protest. When have you used magic in relation to something you felt no control over?\n\ni most often find myself reaching for magic when i'm injured. i absolutely _loathe_ the healing process, but being able to sit with a candle and imagine my tissues and bones lacing themselves back together is really comforting and brings down my stress levels.","lastmodified":"2022-09-06T16:06:38.522352601Z","tags":null},"/braiding-sweetgrass":{"title":"braiding sweetgrass","content":"\na beautiful book written by an indigeneous woman, robin
